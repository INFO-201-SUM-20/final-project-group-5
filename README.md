# Coronavirus and Respiratory Illness
A project dedicated to understanding the effects of respiratory illness on COVID-19.

## Domain of Interest

COVID-19 has altered the world immeasurably. Schools and many workforces have become virtual, travel has been restricted. Mask use has been mandated by the government in many areas in the United States. With no end in site of COVID-19 cases dissipating, our group stems to find out what factors may lead to higher death rates in COVID-19 cases.

#### Related Data Driven Projects
The following projects are related to this domain and have inspired us to conduct additional research.

- [Google's Coronavirus Statistics Data](www.google.com)
uses John Hopkins COVID-19 data to chart the daily cases, as well as deaths caused from Coronavirus throughout the world.

- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) is a volunteer organization that publishes data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The organization has teamed with Center for Antiracist research to create COVID Racial Data Trackers.

- [IMHE COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/alabama) visualizes COVID-19 data infections, deaths, testing, and hospital use. The project allows users to look at projections while changing factors such as masks and social distancing.

#### Data Driven Questions

This project aims to answer some of these following questions:

- What is the prevalence of COVID-19 in contrast to asthma or smoking rates?

- Do populations with higher tobacco use have higher death rates?

- What gender is most affected by COVID-19?


## Finding Data
- [Tobacco Use by State](https://data.cdc.gov/Smoking-Tobacco-Use/2011-Tobacco-Use-Smoke-everyday-by-National-State-/dhij-ubz6) is created by the CDC and collected via cell phone respondents. The dataset features 56 observations and 7 columns. Using this data we can answer if states with higher tobacco use have higher death rates.

- [Coronavirus data in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 3 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 199 observations.

- [Coronavirus by county in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 6 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 405288 observations.

- [Coronavirus mask use in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 6 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 3143 observations.
