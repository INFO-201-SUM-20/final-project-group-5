#  COVID-19 in the United States
A project dedicated to understanding the effects of respiratory illness due to COVID-19 on human population.

## Domain of Interest

COVID-19 has altered the world immeasurably. Schools and many workforces have been shift to become digitized and travel has been restricted. Mask use has been mandated by the government in many areas in the United States. With no end in sight of coronavirus cases dissipating, our group stems to give a visual presentation of COVID-19 incidence rates, as well as explore the correlation between tobacco use and COVID-19 incidence on difference ethnicity as a way
to promote sources that promote equity.

#### Related Data Driven Projects
The following projects are related to this domain and have inspired us to conduct additional research.

- [Google's Coronavirus Statistics Data](www.google.com)
uses John Hopkins COVID-19 data to chart the daily cases, as well as deaths caused from Coronavirus throughout the world.

- [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) is a volunteer organization that publishes data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. The organization has teamed with Center for Antiracist research to create COVID Racial Data Trackers.

- [IMHE COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/alabama) visualizes COVID-19 data infections, deaths, testing, and hospital use. The project allows users to look at projections while changing factors such as masks and social distancing.

#### Data Driven Questions

This project aims to answer these following questions:

- Is there a correlation between COVID-19 incidence rate and **tobacco use** by state? We want to find tobacco rates for U.S states and compare them with how many COVID-19 cases there are currently.

- How does COVID-19 **incidence** and **death rates** vary by state(s)? We want to explore which states have been most affected, and find explore possibilities why COVID-19 has been more prominent in those regions.

- What **ethnicity** is most affected by COVID-19? We want to compare how different ethnic groups have caught COVID-19, recovered and or died.


## Finding Data
- [Tobacco Use by State](https://data.cdc.gov/Smoking-Tobacco-Use/2011-Tobacco-Use-Smoke-everyday-by-National-State-/dhij-ubz6) is created by the CDC and collected via cell phone respondents. The dataset features 56 observations and 7 columns. Using this data we can answer if states with higher tobacco use have higher rates of COVID-19 cases.

- [Coronavirus data in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 3 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 199 observations. We can use this data set to look at COVID-19 daily cases, deaths, and recoveries to answer. We can also see how COVID-19 cases vary by state.

- [Coronavirus by county in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 6 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 405288 observations. We can use this dataset to explore deeper into COVID-19 incidence and death rates in the U.S at the county level.

- [Coronavirus mask use in the US](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv) is created by the New York Times and contains 6 columns (date, cases, deaths) and 3143 observations. This additional dataset can help us explore if mask usage is correlated to any increase or decreases in COVID-19 cases.
